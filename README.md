# 📌 Problem Statement

India’s gig economy relies on delivery partners who earn daily wages strictly based on completed deliveries.

However, workers face income loss due to uncontrollable external disruptions such as:

* Heavy Rain
* Extreme Heatwaves
* Severe Air Pollution
* Mobility Restrictions
* Platform Activity Anomalies

During such events, workers may lose **20–30% of their weekly income**, and there is no real-time protection system.

```mermaid
pie title Weekly Income Loss Due to Disruptions
    "Retained Earnings" : 70
    "Income Lost to Disruptions" : 30
```

---

# Why This Matters

India has over 7 million gig workers heavily dependent on daily income.

Even short disruptions (1–2 days) can significantly impact financial stability.

KavachSathi addresses this gap using automated parametric insurance.

---

# Proposed Concept: KavachSathi

KavachSathi is a parametric micro-insurance system that eliminates manual claims using real-time external signals.

If disruptions reduce earning capacity, the system automatically compensates income loss.

---

# Core System Pillars

1. Weekly Micro-Premiums
2. Algorithmic Risk Scoring
3. Zero-Touch Claims
4. Instant Wallet Payouts

---

# Target User Persona

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/persona.png" width="750">
</p>

| Attribute         | Full-Time Earner      | Part-Time Earner    |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | ------------------- |
| Primary Goal      | Sustaining livelihood | Supplemental income |
| Weekly Earnings   | ₹5,000 - ₹8,000+      | ₹1,500 - ₹3,000     |
| Time on Road      | 10–12 hrs/day         | 3–5 hrs/day         |
| Premium Structure | Fixed weekly          | Usage-based         |
| Income Impact     | Severe                | Moderate            |

---

# Workflow Scenario

Rahul earns ₹5000/week.
A disruption causes ₹1500 loss.

System:

1. Detects disruption
2. Validates conditions
3. Calculates risk
4. Triggers payout

Result: ₹800 credited instantly.

# System Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/architecture.png" width="600">
</p>

* Backend aggregates real-time signals
* AI Risk Engine computes disruption impact
* POP Validator ensures authenticity
* Smart Trigger Logic executes payout
* Premium Engine dynamically adjusts pricing

---

# Decision Engine (Core Innovation)

```text
Risk Score = (Environment × 0.4) + (Platform × 0.4) + (Mobility × 0.2)
```

Risk Score is constrained by caps and segmentation before payout.

### Example

Environment = 80
Platform = 60
Mobility = 40

Risk Score = 64 → Partial payout

### Payout Logic

```text
Risk > 70 → High Payout
40–70 → Partial
< 40 → No Payout
```

---

---

# Risk-Capping Mechanism

* Weekly caps
* Event caps
* Loss ratio monitoring
* Auto-stop if >85% payout ratio

---

# Segment-Specific Insights

* Urban workers → partial disruption patterns
* Rural workers → higher route dependency
* Full-time workers → high income dependency
* Part-time workers → flexible earnings model

---

# Financial Viability Analysis

* Premium: ₹20–₹50
* Loss ratio target: 60–70%

Example:

1000 users → ₹40,000
Payout → ₹26,000
Profit → ₹14,000

---

# Exclusions and Regulatory Awareness

### Exclusions

* Health claims
* Vehicle damage
* Intentional misuse
* Non-disruption income loss

### Compliance

* Parametric insurance aligned structure
* Transparent triggers
* Audit-ready logs
